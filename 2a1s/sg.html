                <h3>&#9641;First, a bit about Indian Classical Music</h3>
                <p>&#8226;The Classical Music of India has its origins in the chanting of the Vedas dating back to several thousands of years ago.</p>
                <p>&#8226;It evolved into two distinct systems, namely, the Carnatic (in the South) and the Hindustani (in the North).</p>
                <p>&#8226;Hindustani classical music is based on melody and rhythm &amp; not harmony.</p>
                <p>&#8226;It is one of the most ancient forms of art widely practiced today.</p>
                <h3>&#9641;In the middle of the 19th century,</h3>
                <p>most Indians in Singapore were labourers, primarily from South India,</p>
                <p>with the majority of them working on plantations and estates, and in the</p>
                <p>government’s public works departments. Soon after, the Indian presence extended beyond labour</p>
                <p>into merchant retail traders and Chettiar moneylenders.</p>
                <h3>&#9641;The Sri Mariamman temple,</h3>
                <p>the first temple to be built in Singapore, and the earliest Sri Sivan temple,</p>
                <p>built in Orchard Road in the 1880s, became the first platforms</p>
                <p>for Indian arts to be staged during Hindu festivals.</p>
                <h3>&#9641;Indian classical music is very much rooted in Singapore,</h3>
                <p>because of dedicated private schools, organisations, and individuals
                <p>keeping the art alive for many decades. There is continual musical communication going on with India</p>
                <p>and a constant stream of Indian artists and teachers who come to Singapore</p>
                <p>to enhance learning and appreciation of Indian music.</p>
                <p>While the arts schools offer training in both North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic) music,</p>
                <p>the latter is dominant as the large majority of the Indian population in Singapore has its origins in South India.</p>
